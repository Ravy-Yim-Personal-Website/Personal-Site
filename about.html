                My Name is Ravy Yim. I love working out, cooking and spending time with my family! 
                I went to school for computer information systems and ended up with a job in finance.
                I have been working with the company I am currently with for about 2 years. I love it!
                I am hoping to further my knowledge in the tech world so that I can eventually start
                my career in the field I am most interested in! 
                </p>
